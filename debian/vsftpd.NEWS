vsftpd (2.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version, vsftpd refuses to serve files in dangerous
  configurations in which the top of the chroot() jail is writable by
  the user that serves files. You may need to adjust the directory
  structure or disable the chroot_local_user option. See
  /usr/share/doc/vsftpd/FAQ.gz for details.
